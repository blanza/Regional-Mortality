Extendend abstract submitted to the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America. 

The objective of this paper is to analyze the regional pattern of adult mortality in Brazil, evaluating the effect of infrastructure, socio-economic, and demographic variables to understand its distribution across the country and over-time

Methods
- use our estimates of adult mortality by small areas
- panel data regression analysis with socioeconomic variables

Importante: justificar a relevância de fazer esse tipo de análise para a mortalidade adulta!!!!
